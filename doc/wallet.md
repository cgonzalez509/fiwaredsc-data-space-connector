# Wallet
DSBA proposes a [decentralized Trust framework compatible with the EU Digital ID Wallet Architecture (**EUDI Wallet**)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework)  

There are a number of initiatives to implement this architecture:
- [EU Digital Identity
Wallet Consortium](https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/)


Known wallets:
- [FIWARE VCWallet](https://github.com/FIWARE/VCWallet): This wallet is intended to be used as a minimal demo application. It does no encryption or verfication of issuers or relying parties. Do NOT use this in production.
- [EBSI Conformant wallets](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EBSI/Conformant+wallets): At this site a number of conformant wallets is displayed.
