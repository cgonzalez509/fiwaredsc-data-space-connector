# Data space Connectors
Welcome to this repository in which though several aproaches we will try to ease:
- The understanding of what a Data Space is
- The reasons why it could make sense (or not) to embrace the data space philosophy in my organization
- The importance of the connectors 
- The components that take part of the Fiware Data Space Connector aproach aligned with the [DSBA Technical Convergence recommendations](https://data-spaces-business-alliance.eu/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/Data-Spaces-Business-Alliance-Technical-Convergence-V2.pdf)
- Which suite of components to deploy to play different roles into a data space.

## What is a Data Space
Multiple definitions can be found describing What is a Data Space is:
- "A data space is a secure and standardized digital infrastructure that enables trusted data
exchange and data-based services among various stakeholders" -[IDSA](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/v/how-to-build-data-spaces)
- "decentralized infrastructure for trustworthy data sharing and exchange in data ecosystems
based on commonly agreed principles" -[OPEN DEI initiative](https://design-principles-for-data-spaces.org/)
- "A federated, open infrastructure for sovereign data sharing based on common policies, rules, and standards." -[Gaia-X](https://gaia-x-hub.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/White_Paper_Definition_Dataspace_EN.pdf)

Among these definitions, the common components are that a data space is compose by different participants (organizations) that agree on common rules, standards and policies to share data and services implementing a technical solution that is accompanied by legal solutions.  
Among the multiple participants, different roles are played. The most common ones are:
- The **"data provider"**: participants that offers data and/or services
- The **"data consumer"**: After the signature of a contract, a consumer participant can access the offered data and/or services.  
- The **"marketplace"**: Data marketplaces, or data markets, are online stores that enable data sharing and collaboration. They connect data providers and data consumers, offering participants the opportunity to buy and sell data and related services in a secure environment. -[Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/data-marketplace#:~:text=Data%20marketplaces%2C%20or%20data%20markets,of%20high%20quality%20and%20consistency.)
- The **"Trust Anchor(s)"**: Ensure trust between the participants
  
## Why my organization could consider embracing a data space?
